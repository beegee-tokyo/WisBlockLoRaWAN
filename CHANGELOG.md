## Documentation

- The file headers of all examples were corrected (three low power / P2P examples carried the header of `BasicLoRaWAN.ino`, the PingPong example had a damaged `@file` name, several had no Doxygen tags at all).
- Every function of the examples and of the library API now has a Doxygen description with `@param` and `@return`. `tools/Doxyfile` generates the documentation: `doxygen tools/Doxyfile`.
- `ATCommandInterface.ino`: the callback parameters were renamed from `r` to `result`, no change in behavior.
